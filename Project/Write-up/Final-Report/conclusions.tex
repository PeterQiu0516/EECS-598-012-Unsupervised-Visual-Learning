While existing 3D objection detection methods are capable of handling difficult cases such as dynamic scenes, occlusion, and deformation, the prediction between frames are usually independent and thus is incapable of evaluating the temporal correspondence. We propose a new framework that builds on the video random-walk model \cite{jabri2020walk}, and integrates 3D information constraints into the affinity matrix and the loss function. Under our formulation, we observe slight improvement with the surface normal constraint with limited training. However, this approach can be subject to small and irregular planes and lead to noisy predictions. In the future work, this approach can be more thoroughly evaluated with more training, and other types of constraints can be applied such as plane texture.
