We will train the PlaneRCNN \cite{liu2019planercnn} on the ScanNet~\cite{dai2017scannet}. We will evaluate our 3D plane detection on raw ScanNet videos and report VOI, RI, SC and AP for planes follow~\cite{liu2019planercnn}. 
We will evaluate object tracking on DAVIS 2017 \cite{pont2017} and report the mean ($m$)
and recall ($r$) of standard boundary alignment ($F$) and region similarity ($J$) metrics, which are detailed in \cite{perazzi2016benchmark}. %We will evaluate the pose tracking on the JHMDB benchmark. All evaluations would have a comparison with~\cite{jabri2020walk}.
